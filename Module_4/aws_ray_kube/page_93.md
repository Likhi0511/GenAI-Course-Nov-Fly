Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE v5.0 as ' Newborn deaths occurring during the first 28 days after birth ' that is felt by the investigator to be at least possibly due to the investigational agent/intervention, should be reported expeditiously, as Grade  4  ' Death  Neonatal ' under  the  system  organ  class  (SOC)  of  'General disorders and administration site conditions', when the death is the result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP-AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.

Unanticipated problems warrant consideration of substantive changes in the screening protocol or informed consent document in order to protect the  safety,  welfare,  or  rights  of  subjects.   In  addition,  unanticipated problems may present unanticipated risks to others (e.g., parents of the subjects)  in  addition  to  the  subjects.   While  these  events  may  not  have caused any detectable harm or adverse effect to subjects or others, they nevertheless  represent  unanticipated  problems  and  should  be  promptly provided to the IRB and DSMC in accordance with HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(a) and 46.103(b)(5).
