More than two years since ChatGPT's launch, we remain in the early innings of AI's diffusion. This is the third iteration of the most comprehensive AI stock mapping exercise in the market. Rate of change continues to drive outperformance, and we believe 2025 will be the year of Agentic AI.

AI's Rate of Change Continues to Surprise: Our first AI Adopter survey was published in January 2024, our second in June 2024. This is our third such analysis. We have been surprised by the continued extent of changes made by our analysts across >3,700 global stocks under coverage. 585 stocks   had their AI exposure or materiality changed ($13trn of market cap). AI model capabilities and costs continue to evolve rapidly and corporate adoption is still low. AI's diffusion is accelerating but decidedly remains in its early innings.

AI's Rate of Change Has Driven Outperformance: Exhibit 1  shows the 2H24 outperformance of stocks which previously saw their exposure and materiality increased. Looking forward, overweight rated stocks matching these criteria in this latest survey have 29% upside to price targets. We explain how to access and use our database and sees three opportunities ahead: (1) Enablers with rising materiality; (2) Adopters with pricing power; (3) Financials with AI 'Rate of Change' tailwinds.

2025 - Agentic AI Adopters: As in previous tech cycles, the equity markets are poised for Semiconductor leadership to give way to the Software Layer. That process is underway. Simply put, AI Agents give "agency" to software programs. In other words AI Adopter companies can move from the reactive "chatbot phase" to the proactive "task-fulfillment phase" of AI; entailing broad productivity gains. We believe 2025 will be a year of Agentic AI, robust enterprise adoption, outperformance of favoured Agentic plays, positive surprises in model capabilities, greater breadth of monetisation and thus diminishing focus on ROI debates.
