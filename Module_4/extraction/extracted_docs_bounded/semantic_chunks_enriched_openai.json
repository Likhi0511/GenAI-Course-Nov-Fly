This is the third iteration of the most comprehensive AI stock mapping exercise in the market. Rate of change continues to drive outperformance, and we believe 2025 will be the year of Agentic AI.\n\nAI's Rate of Change Continues to Surprise: Our first AI Adopter survey was published in January 2024, our second in June 2024. This is our third such analysis. We have been surprised by the continued extent of changes made by our analysts across >3,700 global stocks under coverage. 585 stocks   had their AI exposure or materiality changed ($13trn of market cap). AI model capabilities and costs continue to evolve rapidly and corporate adoption is still low. AI's diffusion is accelerating but decidedly remains in its early innings.\n\nAI's Rate of Change Has Driven Outperformance: Exhibit 1  shows the 2H24 outperformance of stocks which previously saw their exposure and materiality increased. Looking forward, overweight rated stocks matching these criteria in this latest survey have 29% upside to price targets. We explain how to access and use our database and sees three opportunities ahead: (1) Enablers with rising materiality; (2) Adopters with pricing power; (3) Financials with AI 'Rate of Change' tailwinds.\n\n2025 - Agentic AI Adopters: As in previous tech cycles, the equity markets are poised for Semiconductor leadership to give way to the Software Layer. That process is underway. Simply put, AI Agents give \"agency\" to software programs. In other words AI Adopter companies can move from the reactive \"chatbot phase\" to the proactive \"task-fulfillment phase\" of AI; entailing broad productivity gains. We believe 2025 will be a year of Agentic AI, robust enterprise adoption, outperformance of favoured Agentic plays, positive surprises in model capabilities, greater breadth of monetisation and thus diminishing focus on ROI debates.",

The first part lists categories of companies and subcategories (Disrupted, Don't Know, Enabler, Enabler/Adopter, Protected, Wildcard, etc.) associated with a specific number and strategic positioning.

      "content": "## US Leadership Widens Further\n\nThe US has been the global leader in Generative AI from the outset - the transformer technology itself, the competition in foundational model building, the willingness to generate the power needed and the consumer and enterprise adoption needed to reach escape velocity.\n\nExposure: However, our latest survey of analysts does show a surprising dichotomy. In terms of the three exposures that matter most for stock performance (Enabler/Adopter, Enabler and Adopter), the US is largely on par with Europe and Japan in terms of proportion of stocks labelled as such. In fact, the US even lags behind Europe in the proportion of stocks considered Enabler/Adopters. Yet, in market cap terms, the US has double the weighting in Enabler/Adopters relative to Europe and quadruple that of APAC.\n\nMateriality: In terms of Materiality of AI to the investment case, the variances are starker still. Stocks where AI is considered at least moderately important to the investment case amount to c25% of European and APAC coverage but a meaningfully higher c40% of US coverage. In market cap terms, US stocks where AI is considered at least moderately important to the investment case represent >70% of the US market; double the level in Europe. And for the most important Core to Thesis categorisation, the US has c15x higher weighting than Europe or Japan, for example.\n\nThe Rest of World catch-up argument: If there is a compelling argument for the gap to close between the US and other regions, we believe it lies in the Moderate Adopter groupings where the weighting of stocks and market value is comparable across the regions. This is also the grouping for which the rate of change argument holds most upside potential, particularly for corporate margins in Europe and Asia.",

      "content": "## Why AI's Rate of Change Will Continue to Matter\n\nThis report maps the evolution of companies' exposure to AI, how that evolution is perceived by analysts and how it is priced by the market. The reason we think this exercise is valuable to investors is because of: (1) the accelerating capabilities of foundational AI infrastructure, and (2) the fact that this technology is diffusing faster than any before it and into more industries than any before it (see here, here and here).\n\nOver the past 24 months, the speed of change in underlying model capabilities has ratcheted up from reliable output that can displace or supplement 5 second or 5 minute tasks, to models that are providing reliable output (i.e. minimal hallucination) for 15 minute to 1 hour tasks. The latest models focussing on inference-time reasoning (i.e. greater \"thought\" rather than memory regurgitation) is more compute intensive but progresses us towards the potential for 5 hour and eventually 5 day tasks being automated or streamlined.\n\n**Table/Chart**\n*Caption:* Exhibit 18: Our Conceptual Roadmap for AI Developments\n![fig_p7_2.png](../figures/fig_p7_2.png)\n*AI Analysis:* This is a diagram illustrating a conceptual roadmap for AI developments.\n\n**Axes:**\n- **Horizontal Axis (AI Direction of Travel):** Represents time and task complexity from left to right, spanning from \"10 Second Tasks\" to \"5 Hour Tasks.\"\n\n**Trends and Key Insights:**\n- **Task Complexity:** Increases from simple tasks like translation and finding synonyms (10 seconds) to more complex tasks like brainstorming and synthesis involving multiple sources (5 hours).\n- **AI Capability Progression:** Shows past, present, and potential future capabilities of AI systems:\n  - **GPT-3.5:** Achieved passable reliability for the simplest tasks (10 seconds).\n  - **GPT-4.0:** Current reliable performance for more complex tasks (15 minutes).\n  - **GPT-X:** Future goal, aimed at handling the most complex tasks (5 hours).\n\nThe roadmap indicates a trajectory of AI becoming capable of handling tasks of increasing complexity and duration.",
